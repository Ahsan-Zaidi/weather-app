## Description

🔍Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that you can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.

I have created a weather application that allows the user to check weather details in any city they choose. The purpose of this app is to keep our users prepared for any weather conditions they might face.
